# Laptop Computer

A laptop, often called a notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use. Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap when being used.

Laptops differ from desktop computers in that they combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer, including the display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, pointing devices (such as a touch pad or pointing stick), with an operating system processor and memory into a single unit. Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while many also have touchscreens. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop).

### Types of Laptops

Traditional laptops are designed for general-purpose use, balancing performance, battery life, and portability. They come in various screen sizes, typically ranging from 13 to 17 inches. These form the bulk of the market and are used by students and office workers for tasks like browsing, document editing, and media consumption.

Gaming laptops are designed primarily for playing computer games. They require high-end graphics cards and processors, which generate significant heat, often necessitating bulky cooling systems. As a result, they tend to be larger, heavier, and have shorter battery life than standard laptops, but they offer performance comparable to desktop computers.

Convertible laptops, also known as 2-in-1s, have a hybrid design that allows them to function as both a laptop and a tablet. They often feature a touchscreen and a hinge that rotates 360 degrees or a detachable keyboard. This versatility makes them popular among creative professionals and users who consume a lot of media on the go.

### Laptop Hardware

The hardware of a laptop is similar to that of a desktop but miniaturized and optimized for power efficiency and heat management. The internal components are tightly packed, and unlike desktops, many parts like the processor and memory might be soldered directly onto the motherboard to save space, making upgrades difficult or impossible.

Performance is largely determined by the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM), and the type of storage used. Modern laptops increasingly use Solid State Drives (SSD) instead of Hard Disk Drives (HDD) because they are faster, quieter, and more resistant to physical shock, which is crucial for a portable device.
